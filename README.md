# Introduction
Small example that demonstrates communication between components. Consists of three components:
- AppComponent: Brings everything together and owns the order array
- SearchComponent: Is responsible for performing searches and can tell the AppComponent to add a product to the order
- OrderComponent: Shows what is currently in the order and can tell the AppComponent to remove a product from the order

# Run the example application

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
